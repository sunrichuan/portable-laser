Portable low-power laser weapons
In order to meet the requirements of portability, concealment, low cost, and ease of manufacturing, this portable laser has been designed.
This project includes Gerber files, bill of materials, production tutorials, and shell model files for 3D printing.
Using a Nubm8 laser diode, containing a 1000maH polymer lithium battery, it can operate at full power in a short period of time.
The designer is a beginner, and the circuit part may not be perfect.
The designer is a Chinese high school student, so there is very little spare time and not much energy to maintain this project.
